## Introduction to SPACEX

SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk in 2002, is a private aerospace manufacturer and space transportation company. One of its most notable achievements is the development of the Falcon 9 rocket. Costing about $62 million each, it’s a reusable two-stage rocket designed for the reliable and safe transport of satellites into orbit. The Falcon 9 is known for its ability to return its first stage to Earth, which brings us to our analysis. If we can predict if the first stage will land or not, we can help determine the cost for each launch. Based on data from the web, we are going to use Machine Learning techniques to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. ​
